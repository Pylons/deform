TODO

- docs
- delete beautify.css?
- decide how to explain form.css (include in requirements or?)
- horizontal/inline forms + structural things
- assets for templates: deform should provide a tool to resolve that?
- placeholder support for all textual inputs (and required/maxlength
  see also https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116)
- display help-blocks for readonly fields?
- maybe readonly should be a property of the schema, not the widget.
- consider whether "style"/"css_class" on multi-input widgets should apply to
  a container or each element.
- some sort of test for mapping_item input_prepend/input_append
- Currently description shows up as both tooltip of label and as help-block.
  Maybe make these two things separate or at least don't show them both using
  the same value.
- sequence_of_sequences: js that processes close/order buttons has to 
  be less promiscuous (it uses e.g. "find"); symptom: buttons
  appear/disappear, act on the wrong element, etc... ugh 2013/10/05
  cannot replicate, but still believe there may be an issue, but
  maybe iElectric fixed it

NEW FEATURES:

- input_prepend/input_append in mapping_item widget.
- field.parent
- field.get_root
- inline attr of checkboxchoice and radiochoice widgets (see
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/182)
- http://deform2demo.repoze.org/

MIGRATION NOTES: 

- removed deprecated `height, width, skin, theme` parameters from RichTextWidget
  (use "options" instead)
- removed deprecated `render_initial_item` from SequenceWidget
- removed deprecated deform.Set (use colander.Set instead)
- DateInputWidget renamed parameter `dateFormat` to `format` (dateFormat
  now unsupported).
- DateTimeInputWidget now renders as two fields: one for a date and one
  for a time, using pickadate.
- We no longer bother trying to use the native datetimeinput widget on any
  browser, because the support is so spotty.
- DateTimeInputWidget takes two options now: date_options and time_options
  instead of a single options dictionary.  The options are pickadate
  date/time options respectively.
- It is no longer possible to do DateTimeWidget().options['a'] = 'foo'
  or DateTimeWidget().date_options['a'] = 'foo'.  If you need to change
  options imperatively, set the entire .options/.date_options dictionary.
- merged TypeaheadInputWidget to AutocompleteInputWidget (removed delay 
  parameter)
- AutocompleteInputWidget now accepts string type for "values"
- widgets no longer accepts "size" (instead use style="width: x"), except
  SelectWidget (it means the size of the dropdown)
- get_widget_resources now returns asset specifications rather than
  deform-static-relative paths
- deform 2.0 requires users to manually load TB 3.0 and jquery 2.0
- required labels no longer insert an asterisk inside a <span class="req">
  inside themselves.  instead the label element has a required class
  if the field is required; use form.css to display this as an asterisk.
- min_length of AutocompleteInputWidget now defaults to 1 (was 2)
- CSS class names normalized.  Instead of camelCase names (e.g. ``deformSeq``),
  we now use dashed-names (e.g. ``deform-seq``).  A full list of changes is
  below::

NICE TO HAVE

- structural widget (mapping_item.pt) - do we need that or not or what? + 
  add a demo
- prepend/append t.bootstrap stuff
- https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116#issuecomment-23210460
- group demos by widget type
- handle ajax demo more UX friendly
- Put drag handles in panel headers: https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/180
