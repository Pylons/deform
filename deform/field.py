class Field(object):
    """ Represents an individual form field (a visible object in a
    form rendering).

    A :class:`deform.form.Field` object instance is meant to last for
    the duration of a single web request. As a result, a field object
    is often used as a scratchpad by the widget associated with that
    field.  Using a field as a scratchpad makes it possible to build
    implementations of state-retaining widgets while instances of
    those widget still only need to be constructed once instead of on
    each request.
    
    *Attributes*

        schema
            The schema node associated with this field.

        widget
            The widget associated with this field.

        order
            An integer indicating the relative order of this field's
            construction to its children and parents.

        oid
            A string incorporating the ``order`` attribute that can be
            used as a unique identifier in HTML code (often for ``id``
            attributes of field-related elements).  An example oid is
            ``deformField0``.

        name
            An alias for self.schema.name
        
        title
            An alias for self.schema.title

        description
            An alias for self.schema.description

        required
            An alias for self.schema.required

        typ
            An alias for self.schema.typ

        children
            Child fields of this field.

        error
            The exception raised by the last attempted validation of the
            schema element associated with this field.  By default, this
            attribute is ``None``.  If non-None, this attribute is usually
            an instance of the exception class
            :exc:`colander.Invalid`, which has a ``msg`` attribute
            providing a human-readable validation error message.

        errormsg
            The ``msg`` attribute of the ``error`` attached to this field
            or ``None`` if the ``error`` attached to this field is ``None``.

        renderer
            The template :term:`renderer` associated with the form.  If a
            renderer is not passed to the constructor, the default deform
            renderer will be used (the :term:`default renderer`).

        counter
            ``None`` or an instance of ``itertools.counter`` which is used
            to generate sequential order-related attributes such as
            ``oid`` and ``order``.

        resource_registry
            The :term:`resource registry` associated with this field.

    *Constructor Arguments*

      ``renderer``, ``counter`` and ``resource_registry`` are accepted
      as explicit keyword arguments to the :class:`deform.Field`.
      These are also available as attribute values.  ``renderer``, if
      passed, is a template renderer as described in
      :ref:`creating_a_renderer`.  ``counter``, if passed, should be
      an :attr:`itertools.counter` object (useful when rendering
      multiple forms on the same page, see
      `http://deformdemo.repoze.org/multiple_forms/
      <http://deformdemo.repoze.org/multiple_forms/>`_.
      ``resource_registry``, if passed should be a widget resource
      registry (see also :ref:`get_widget_resources`).

      If any of these values is ``None`` (their default), suitable
      default values are used in their place.

      The :class:`deform.Field` constructor also accepts *arbitrary*
      keyword arguments.  When an 'unknown' keyword argument is
      passed, it is attached unmolested to the form field as an
      attribute.

      All keyword arguments (explicit and unknown) are also attached to
      all *children* nodes of the field being constructed.

        The keys of the dictionary are dotted names.  Each dotted name

        The dotted name is split on its dots and the resulting list of

        - If the key is the empty string (``''``), the widget is
          assigned to the field upon which this method is called.

        - If the key contains an asterisk as an element name, the
          first child of the found element is traversed.  This is most
          useful for sequence fields, because the first (and only)
          child of sequence fields is always the prototype field which
          is used to render all fields in the sequence within a form
          rendering.

        If the ``separator`` argument is passed, it is should be a
        string to be used as the dot character when splitting the
        dotted names (useful for supplying if one of your field object
        has a dot in its name, and you need to use a different
        separator).

        Examples follow.  If the following form is used::

          class Person(Schema):

        - if the fields are successfully validated, a data structure
          represented by the deserialization of the data as per the

        - If the fields cannot be successfully validated, a
