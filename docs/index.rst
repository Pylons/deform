Deform
======

:mod:`deform` is a Python HTML form generation library.

The design of :mod:`deform` is heavily influenced by the `formish
<http://ish.io/projects/show/formish>`_ form generation library.  Some
might even say it's a shameless rip-off; this would not be completely
inaccurate.  It differs from formish mostly in ways that make the
implementation (arguably) simpler and smaller.

:mod:`deform` uses :term:`Colander` as a schema library,
:term:`Peppercorn` as a form control deserialization library, and
:term:`Chameleon` to perform HTML templating.

:mod:`deform` depends only on Peppercorn, Colander, Chameleon and an
internationalization library named translationstring, so it may be
used in most web frameworks (or antiframeworks) as a result.

Alternate templating languages may be used, as long as all templates
are translated from the native Chameleon templates to your templating
system of choice and a suitable :term:`renderer` is supplied to
:mod:`deform`.
