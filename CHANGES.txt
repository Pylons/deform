Changes
=======

Next release
------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Fix CSS of autocomplete widget when obtaining resources using
  ``get_widget_resources`` (``jquery.autocomplete.css`` was missing as
  a resource to the ``jquery.autocomplete`` requirement).

- Sequence widgets are no longer 'structural' by default; they now
  print the label of the sequence above the sequence adder.

Internal
~~~~~~~~

- The various deform* JavaScript functions in ``deform.js`` have now
  been moved into a top-level namespace.  For example, where it was
  necessary to call ``deformFocusFirstInput()`` before, it is now
  necessary to call ``deform.focusFirstInput()``.

- Make the TinyMCE rich text widget use ``mode: 'exact'`` instead of
  ``mode: 'textareas'``.

- Change sequence adding logic to be slightly simpler.

0.5 (2010-08-25)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added features which make it possible to inquire about which
  resources (JavaScript and CSS resources) are required by all the
  widgets that make up a form rendering.  Also make it possible for a
  newly created widget to specify its requirements.  See "Widget
  Requirements and Resources" in the widgets chapter of the
  documentation.

- Add the ``get_widget_requirements`` method to ``deform.Field``
  objects.

- Add the ``get_widget_resources`` method to ``deform.Field``
  objects.

- Allow ``deform.Field`` (and ``deform.Form``) objects to accept a
  "resource registry" as a constructor argument.

- Add the ``deform.Field.set_widgets`` method, which allows a
  (potentially nested) set of widgets to be applied to children fields
  of the field upon which it is called.

- Add the ``deform.widget.TextInputCSV`` widget.  This widget is
  exactly like the ``deform.widget.TextAreaCSV`` widget except it
  accepts a single line of input only.

- The default widget for ``colander.Tuple`` schema types is now
  ``deform.widget.TextInputCSV``.

- The ``deform.widget.FileUploadWidget`` now returns an instance of
  ``deform.widget.filedict`` instead of a plain dictionary to make it
  possible (using isinstance) to tell the difference between file
  upload data and a plain data dictionary for highly generalized
  persistence code.

0.4 (2010-08-22)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When the hidden widget is used to deserialize a field, return
  ``colander.null`` rather than the empty string so that it may be
  used to represent non-text fields such as ``colander.Integer``.
  This is isomorphic to the change done previously to
  ``deform.TextInputWidget`` to support nontextual empty fields.

- Fix typo about overriding templates using set_zpt_renderer in
  templating chapter.

- Fix link to imperative schema within in Colander docs within "Basics".

- Remove duplicate ``deform.widget.DateInputWidget`` class definition.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add a ``deform.widget.RichTextWidget`` widget, which adds the 
  TinyMCE WYSIWIG javascript editor to a text area.

- Add a ``deform.widget.AutocompleteInputWidget`` widget, which adds
  a text input that can be supplied a URL or iterable of choices to
  ease the search and selection of a finite set of choices.

- The ``deform.widget.Widget`` class now accepts an extra keyword
  argument in its constructor: ``css_class``.

- All widgets now inherit a ``css_class`` attribute from the base
  ``deform.widget.Widget`` class.  If `css_class`` contains a value,
  the "primary" element in the rendered widget will get a CSS
  ``class`` attribute equal to the value ("primary" is defined by the
  widget template's implementor).

- The ``deform.Field`` class now as an ``__iter__`` method which
  iterates over the children fields of the field upon which it is
  called (``for item in field`` == ``for item in field.children``).

0.3
---

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Change default form action to the empty string (rather than ``.``).
  Thanks to Kiran.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add ``deform.widget.DateInputWidget`` widget, which is a date picker
  widget.  This has now become the default widget for the
  ``colander.Date`` schema type, preferred to the date parts widget.

- Add text input mask capability to ``deform.widget.TextInputWidget``.

- Add text input mask capability to
  ``deform.widget.CheckedInputWidget``.

Backwards Incompatibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Custom widgets must now check for ``colander.null`` rather than
  ``None`` as the null sentinel value.

- Dependency on a new (0.7) version of Colander, which has been
  changed to make using proper defaults possible; if you've used the
  ``default`` argument to a ``colander.SchemaNode``, or if you've
  defined a custom Colander type, you'll want to read `the updated
  Colander documentation <http://docs.repoze.org/colander>`_
  (particularly the changelist).  Short story: use the ``missing``
  argument instead.

- If you've created a custom widget, you will need to tweak it
  slightly to handle the value ``colander.null`` as input to both
  ``serialize`` and ``deserialize``.  See the Deform docs at
  `http://docs.repoze.org/deform <http://docs.repoze.org/deform>`_ for
  more information.

0.2 (2010-05-13)
----------------

- Every form has a formid now, defaulting to ``deform``.  The formid
  is used to compute the id of the form tag as well as the button ids
  in the form.  Previously, if a formid was not passed to the Form
  constructor, no id would be given to the rendered form and the
  form's buttons would not be prefixed with any formid.

- The ``deform.Form`` class now accepts two extra keyword arguments in
  its constructor: ``use_ajax`` and ``ajax_options``.

  If ``use_ajax`` is ``True``, the page is not reloaded when a submit
  button is pressed.  Instead, the form is posted, and the result
  replaces the DOM node on the page.

  ``ajax_options`` is a string which allows you to pass extra options
  to the underlying AJAX form machinery when ``use_ajax`` is True.

- Added a couple Ajax examples to the demo app.

- Add a rudimentary Ajax chapter to the docs.

0.1 (2010-05-09)
----------------

- Initial release.
