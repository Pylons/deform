.. _2.0.14:

2.0.14 (2020-08-26)
-------------------

- Field.validate() now raises ``ValidationFailure`` upon peppercorn parse
  failure.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/242

- Bump maskMoney.js to 3.1.1 and use minified version.
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/412


.. _2.0.13:

2.0.13 (2020-08-25)
-------------------

- ``richtext.pt``: The contents of the ``RichTextWidget``'s <textarea>
  was not HTML-escaped, but now it is.

  Note that unescaped content is still rendered if ``delayed_load`` is
  enabled.  Now, however, to avoid rendering unescaped non-validated
  user input, ``delayed_load`` is ignored when redisplaying a field
  containing an error.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/204

- This time, *really* update select2 widget to version 4.0.13.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/459


.. _2.0.12:

2.0.12 (2020-08-23)
-------------------

- Update select2 widget to version 4.0.13.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/441

- Add the ``structure`` keyword to the autocomplete template's options to stop
  its encoding.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/445

- Use the local HTML element for change event when removing/adding to DOM.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/331

- Fix deprecation warning when importing the module ``field.py`` while testing
  with pytest.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/419

- Fix a bug that was introduced in 2.0.11 that made it such that the ``focus``
  parameter on forms did not honor the ``off`` value for ``checkboxChoice`` and
  ``radioChoice`` widgets.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/453

- Remove the unused variable ``namematch`` from deform.js.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/454

- Add i18n domain and Bootstrap styles to template ``readonly/password.pt``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/237


.. _2.0.11:

2.0.11 (2020-08-21)
-------------------

- Drop support of Python 3.4.

- Changed the implementation of input autofocus from JavaScript to an HTML5
  input attribute.

  Forms now have an optional ``focus`` parameter (``on`` or ``off``) and fields
  have an optional ``autofocus`` parameter.

  -   If ``focus`` is ``on``, and at least one field has an ``autofocus``
      schema parameter set to ``on``, the first of these fields will
      receive focus on page load.
  -   If ``focus`` is ``on`` or omitted, and no field has an
      ``autofocus`` schema parameter set to ``on``, the first input of
      the first form on the page will receive focus on page load.
  -   If ``focus`` is ``off``, no focusing will be done.

  Default: ``on``.
  (This is unchanged from the JavaScript implementation.)

  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/365/

- Replace the flake8-isort plugin with plain old isort.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/427

- Improved the script that launches Selenium webdriver to clean up the locale
  directory after completing a run of functional tests so that its files do not
  get committed by accident. We also enforce coding style and add a formatter,
  and improved the contributing documentation.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/428

- Updated Bootstrap to 3.4.1.


.. _2.0.10:

2.0.10 (2020-07-03)

- Add boolean HTML attributes per Chameleon 3.8.0.

  All checkboxes, radios, and selects that use boolean HTML attributes
  (selected, checked, etc.) previously used `literal_false` and would drop any
  `False` value from rendering as an HTML attribute. In Chameleon 3.8.0,
  `literal_false` is removed and must instead use `boolean_attributes` to set
  defaults.

  below::

    errorMsgLbl                       error-msg-lbl

- Fixed handling of buttons in nested sequences.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/197

- Upload widget is themed like Bootstrap https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/280

- Select widget handles the mixture of strings and ints https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/300/ and https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/299

- Have the button css_class override the default button class. This is
  backwards-incompatible and will require users of css_class to add a
  btn-default/btn-primary class to the css_class.

- Simplified Chinese translation https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/274

- Don't cause unnecessary JavaScript calls on page load https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/267/

- Allow override Button Bootstap CSS styles https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/251

2.0a2 (2013-10-18)
------------------

- ``PasswordWidget`` and ``CheckedPasswordWidget`` have grown an additional
  argument/attribute named ``redisplay``, which controls what happens on a
  validation failure of a form involving such a field.  If ``redisplay`` is
  ``True`` (the default), the password will be re-rendered into the form when
  the form is re-rendered after validation failure.  If ``redisplay`` is
  ``False``, the password will not be re-rendered into the form.  The default
  is ``False``, which means that, as of this release, passwords will not
  be redisplayed; this changes the default behavior wrt previous releases.
  Values typed into password fields are not redisplayed by default during
  validation failure, as a security measure (the value winds up in browser
  history).  Use ``PasswordWidget(redisplay=True)`` or
  ``CheckedPasswordWidget(redisplay=True)`` to make these widgets redisplay
  passwords on validation failures, matching the old behavior.

- When using the default Chameleon template renderer, template names can now
  be "asset specifications" e.g. ``mypackage:subdir1/subdir2/mytemplate.pt``
  instead of extensionless paths relative to a search path.  When
  template names are specified as asset specifications, the
  ``pkg_resources.resource_filename`` API is used to dereference them
  into an actual file path.

2.0a1 (2013-10-05)
------------------

This is an alpha release of Deform v2.  Deform v2 is backwards incompatible
with Deform v1.  It requires the use of Twitter Bootstrap v3, whereas
deform v1 did not require Bootstrap.

A demonstration site that shows Deform 2 in action exists at
https://deformdemo.pylonsproject.org.

Both Deform 1 and Deform 2 will be maintained going forward.  If you wish
to continue using Deform 1, because you cannot upgrade, or cannot depend on
Bootstrap 3, please pin your deform distribution requirement to
something below 2.0a1, e.g. ``deform<=1.999``.

This first alpha release is missing formal documentation updates.  Apologies,
we needed to get a release out onto PyPI, as not having one is holding back
the development of a number of platforms and applications that depend on the
changes in v2+.  Documentation updates will be forthcoming over the lifetime
of future alpha/beta releases.  However, below is a list of known issues that
need to be addressed to make a final release of Deform 2, as well as
information about new features, and migration notes.  You may also be
able to make use of the demo site at https://deformdemo.pylonsproject.org to
divine how things have changed, and what CSS and JavaScript resources you'll
need to include in your pages to make use of this release.

TODO

- docs
- decide how to explain form.css (include in requirements or?)
- horizontal/inline forms + structural things
- assets for templates: deform should provide a tool to resolve that?
- placeholder support for all textual inputs (and required/maxlength
  see also https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116)
- display help-blocks for readonly fields?
- maybe readonly should be a property of the schema, not the widget.
- consider whether "style"/"css_class" on multi-input widgets should apply to
  a container or each element.
- audit use of e.g. string:${css_class} so we don't see unexpected class="None"
  in widget rendering output.
- some sort of test for mapping_item input_prepend/input_append
- Currently description shows up as both tooltip of label and as help-block.
  Maybe make these two things separate or at least don't show them both using
  the same value.
- normalize CSS class names to deform-foo rather than deformFoo
- sequence_of_sequences: js that processes close/order buttons has to
  be less promiscuous (it uses e.g. "find"); symptom: buttons
  appear/disappear, act on the wrong element, etc... ugh 2013/10/05
  cannot replicate, but still believe there may be an issue, but
  maybe iElectric fixed it

NICE TO HAVE

- structural widget (mapping_item.pt) - do we need that or not or what? +
  add a demo
- prepend/append t.bootstrap stuff
- https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116#issuecomment-23210460
- group demos by widget type
- handle ajax demo more UX friendly
- Put drag handles in panel headers: https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/180

NEW FEATURES:

- input_prepend/input_append in mapping_item widget.
- field.parent
- field.get_root
- inline attr of checkboxchoice and radiochoice widgets (see
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/182)
- https://deformdemo.pylonsproject.org/

MIGRATION NOTES:

- removed deprecated `height, width, skin, theme` parameters from RichTextWidget
  (use "options" instead)
- removed deprecated `render_initial_item` from SequenceWidget
- removed deprecated deform.Set (use colander.Set instead)
- DateInputWidget renamed parameter `dateFormat` to `format` (dateFormat
  now unsupported).
- DateTimeInputWidget now renders as two fields: one for a date and one
  for a time, using pickadate.
- We no longer bother trying to use the native datetimeinput widget on any
  browser, because the support is so spotty.
- DateTimeInputWidget takes two options now: date_options and time_options
  instead of a single options dictionary.  The options are pickadate
  date/time options respectively.
- It is no longer possible to do DateTimeWidget().options['a'] = 'foo'
  or DateTimeWidget().date_options['a'] = 'foo'.  If you need to change
  options imperatively, set the entire .options/.date_options dictionary.
- merged TypeaheadInputWidget to AutocompleteInputWidget (removed delay
  parameter)
- AutocompleteInputWidget now accepts string type for "values"
- widgets no longer accepts "size" (instead use style="width: x"), except
  SelectWidget (it means the size of the dropdown)
- get_widget_resources now returns asset specifications rather than
  deform-static-relative paths
- deform 2.0 requires users to manually load TB 3.0 and jquery 2.0
- required labels no longer insert an asterisk inside a <span class="req">
  inside themselves.  instead the label element has a required class
  if the field is required; use form.css to display this as an asterisk.
- min_length of AutocompleteInputWidget now defaults to 1 (was 2)
