Changes
=======

0.9.4 (2011-02-14)
------------------

- No longer Python 2.5 compatible.  Python 2.6+ is required.

- Python 3.2 compatible.

- Translate title attribute for remove button in sequence fields.

- Do not output empty error messages for sequence items. After translation
  these would insert the PO file metadata.

- Update to lingua for translations, add french translation

- fix multiple i18n issues.

- Fix a bug where displaying error could lead on an error when you have
  imbricated Mapping objects

- Fix ssue #54: form.pt does not show validation errors from the top node of
  the schema. See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/54 for more
  information.

- Previously, all CheckedInputWidget and CheckedPasswordWidget fields had
  hardcoded input[name] attributes of 'value' and 'confirm'.  When
  deserializing a form, this caused colander.null to be passed to the widget
  deserialization function since neither submitted value matched the name of
  the field.  This change simply replaces 'value' with the name of the field
  and 'confirm' with the name of the field with '-confirm' appended.

- In select widget, add css_class to <select> rather than only <option>.

- Allow RichText fields to load their editor only after clicking on them

- There is no longer a ``deform_ajaxify`` global javascript function.
  Instead forms are AJAXified directly by the javascript callback for the
  form.

0.9.3 (2011-08-10)
------------------

- Update Dutch translations.

- Translate title and description of items for sequence fields.

- Add a new API method to field objects: ``translate``.  This method will use
  the translator passed to the underlying renderer to translate message ids
  into text.

0.9.2 (2011-07-22)
------------------

- Chameleon 2 compatibility.

- Use default widgets for a schema's baseclass if known instead of always
  falling back to a text widget.


- Deform now includes a ``beautify.css`` (contributed by Ergo^) in its static
  directory, which can be used to make form element styling prettier.

- Moved ``deformdemo`` into its own package and Github repository
  (https://github.com/Pylons/deformdemo).

0.9.1 (2011-06-23)
------------------

- Add Dutch translation.

- Add the ``deform.widget.DateTimeWidget`` widget, which uses the jQueryUI
  Timepicker add-on.

  ``DateTimeWidget`` uses the ISO8601 combined date and time format
  internally, as expected by ``colander.DateTime``, but converts to
  the more friendly separate date and time format for display in the
  widget.

  This widget is now the default for colander.DateTime schema types.

- Upgrade to jquery-ui 1.8.11, as required by the timepicker.

- Compile all ``.po`` files to ``.mo`` in ``deform/locale`` and remove Texan
  locale (funny, but breaks ``python setup.py compile_catalog`` with an
  UnknownLocale error.)

- Fix references to repoze.bfg and update obsoletes URLs in the demo application

- Remove unused ``jquery.autocomplete.min.js`` file from static directory.

- SelectWidget now has a ``size`` attribute to support single select widgets
  that are not dropdowns.

- The value fed to the ``deform.form.Button`` class as ``name`` would
  generate an invalid HTML id if it contained spaces.  Now it converts spaces
  to underscores if they exist in the name.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/14 .

- Deformdemo application now has a Time field demonstration.

- Deform Chameleon templates now contain i18n:translate tags.

- German translation updated.

- Fixed invalid HTML generated for "select" widget.

- When using an ajax form without a redirect, a submit overwrites the form.
  In the case of a form validation failure on first submit, no event handlers
  were registered to submit the form via ajax on the second submit.  This is
  now fixed.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/1 .

0.9 (2011-03-01)
----------------

- Moved to GitHub (https://github.com/Pylons/deform).

- Added tox.ini for testing purposes.

- Fix select dropdown behavior on Firefox by fixing CSS (closes
  http://bugs.repoze.org/issue152).

- Removed ``wufoo.css``, minimized ``form.css``.  Changed templates around to
  deal with CSS changes.

- Sequence widgets now accept a min_len and a max_len argument, which
  influences its display of close and add buttons.

- Convert demo application from repoze.bfg to Pyramid.

- Depend on Chameleon<1.999 (deform doesn't yet work with Chameleon 2).

0.8.1 (2010-12-17)
------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Allow ``deform.form.Button`` class to be passed a ``disabled`` flag (false
  by default).  If a Button is disabled, its HTML ``disabled`` setting will
  be set true.

0.8 (2010-12-02)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added Polish locale data: thanks to Marcin Lulek.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix dynamic sequence item adding on Chrome and Firefox 4.  Previously if
  there was a validation error rendering a set of sequence items, the "add
  more" link would be rendered outside the form, which would cause it to not
  work.  Wrapping the sequence item <li> element in a <ul> fixed this.

0.7 (2010-10-10)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added Danish locale.

- Added Spanish locale:  thanks to David Cerna for the translations!

- ``DatePartsWidget`` now renders error "Required" if all blank or
  "Incomplete" if partially blank for consistency with the other widgets.

- Different styling involving <li> and <ul> for checkbox choice,
  checked input, radio choice, checked password, and dateparts widgets
  (via Ergo^). See http://bugs.repoze.org/issue165.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Deform now depends on ``colander`` version 0.8 or better (the demo
  wants to use schema bindings).

- Deform now depends on ``Chameleon`` (uppercase) rather than
  ``chameleon`` to allow for non-PyPI servers.

Demo
~~~~

- New addition to the demonstration application: schema binding.

0.6 (2010-09-03)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Sequence widgets are no longer ``structural`` by default; they now
  print the label of the sequence above the sequence adder.

- Radio buttons in a radio button choice widget are now spaced closer
  together and the button is on the left hand side.

- The sequence remove button is no longer an image.

- The sequence widget now puts the sequence adding link *after* any
  existing items in the sequence (previously the link was always
  beneath the sequence title).

- It is now possible to associate a widget with a schema node within
  the schema directly.  For example::

    import colander
    import deform.widget

    class MySchema(Schema):
        description = colander.SchemaNode(
                          colander.String(),
                          widget=deform.widget.RichTextWidget()
                          )

  For more information, see "Changing the Default Widget Associated
  With a Field" in the documentation.

- The constructor of ``deform.Field`` objects (and thus
  ``deform.Form`` objects) now accept arbitrary keyword arguments,
  each of which is attached to the field or form object being
  constructed, as well as being attached to its descendant fields
  recursively.

- The form object's template now respects the ``css_class`` argument /
  attribute of the form node.

- CheckboxChoice and RadioChoice widgets now use <ul> and <li> to
  display individual choice elements (thanks to Ergo^), and both
  widgets put the label after the element instead of before as
  previously.

- The ``deform.widget.AutocompleteInputWidget`` widget now uses
  `JQuery UI's autocomplete sublibrary
  <http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete>` instead of the
  ``jquery.autocomplete`` library to perform its job in order to
  reduce the number of libraries needed by Deform.  Some options have
  been changed as a result, and the set of resources returned by
  ``form.get_widget_resources`` has changed.

  This change also implies that when a widget which uses a remote URL
  as a ``values`` input, the remote URL must return a JSON structure
  instead of a ``\n``-delimited list of values.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This Deform version requires ``colander`` version 0.7.3 or better.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``RichTextWidget``, ``AutocompleteInputWidget``, ``TextInputWidget``
  with input masks, and ``CheckedInputWidget`` with input masks could
  not be used properly within sequences.  Now they can be.  See also
  ``Internal`` and ``Backwards Incompatibilities`` within this
  release's notes.  This necessitated new required ``deform.load()``
  and ``deform.addCallback()`` JavaScript APIs.

- Radio choice widgets included within a submapping no longer put
  their selections on separate lines.

- Rich text widgets are now 500 pixels wide by default instead of 640.

- RadioChoiceWidgets did not work when they were used within
  sequences.  Making them work required some changes to the its
  template and it added a dependency on ``peppercorn`` >= 0.3.

- To make radio choice widgets work within sequences, the
  deform.addSequenceItem JavaScript method needed to be changed.  It
  will now change the value of ``name`` attributes which contain a
  marker that looks like an field oid (e.g. ``deformField1``), and,
  like the code which changes ids in the same manner, appends a random
  component (e.g. ``deformField1-HL6sgP``).  This is to support radio
  button groupings.

- The mapping and sequence item templates now correctly display errors
  with ``msg`` values that are lists.  Previously, a repr of a Python
  list was displayed when a widget had an error with a ``msg`` value
  that was a list; now multiple <p> nodes are inserted into the
  rendering, each <p> node containing an individual error message.
  (Note that this change requires colander 0.7.3).

Backwards Incompatibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The JavaScript function ``deform.load()`` now *must* be called by
  the HTML page (usually in a script tag near the end of the page, ala
  ``<script..>deform.load()</script>``) which renders a Deform form in
  order for widgets which use JavaScript to do proper event and
  behavior binding.  If this function is not called, built-in widgets
  which use JavaScript will no longer function properly.

- The JavaScript function ``deformFocusFirstInput`` was removed.  This
  is now implied by ``deform.load()``.

- The ``closebutton_url`` argument to the SequenceWidget no longer
  does anything.  Style the widget template via CSS to add an image.

Internal
~~~~~~~~

- Provided better instructions for running the demo app and running
  the tests for the demo app in ``deformdemo/README.txt``.

- Try to prevent false test failures by injecting sleep statements in
  things that use ``browser.key_press``.

- Moved ``deformdemo/tests/test_demo.py`` to ``deformdemo/test.py`` as
  well as moving ``deformdemo/tests/selenium.py`` to
  ``deformdemo/selenium.py``.  Removed the ``deformdemo/tests``
  subdirectory.

- The date input widget now uses JQueryUI's ``datepicker``
  functionality rather than relying on JQuery Tools' ``date`` input.
  The latter was broken for sequences, and the former works fine.

- The various deform* JavaScript functions in ``deform.js`` have now
  been moved into a top-level namespace.  For example, where it was
  necessary to call ``deformFocusFirstInput()`` before, it is now
  necessary to call ``deform.focusFirstInput()``.

- Make the TinyMCE rich text widget use ``mode: 'exact'`` instead of
  ``mode: 'textareas'``.

- ``richtext``, ``autocomplete_input``, ``textinput``,
  ``checked_input``, and ``dateinput``, and ``form`` templates now use
  the new ``deform.addCallback`` indirection instead of each
  registering their own JQuery callback or performing their own
  initialization logic, so that each may be used properly within
  sequences.

- Change sequence adding logic to be slightly simpler.

- The sample app form page now calls ``deform.load()`` rather than
  ``deformFocusFirstInput()``.

- Added new demo app views for showing a sequence of autocompletes, a
  sequence of dateinputs, a sequence of richtext fields, a sequence of
  radio choice widgets and a sequence of text inputs with masks and
  tests for same.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a note about ``get_widget_resources`` to the "Basics"
  chapter.

- Added a note about ``deform.load()`` JavaScript requiredness to the
  "Basics" chapter.

- Add new top-level sections named ``Widget Templates`` and ``Widget
  JavaScript`` to the "Widgets" chapter.

0.5 (2010-08-25)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added features which make it possible to inquire about which
  resources (JavaScript and CSS resources) are required by all the
  widgets that make up a form rendering.  Also make it possible for a
  newly created widget to specify its requirements.  See "Widget
  Requirements and Resources" in the widgets chapter of the
  documentation.

- Add the ``get_widget_requirements`` method to ``deform.Field``
  objects.

- Add the ``get_widget_resources`` method to ``deform.Field``
  objects.

- Allow ``deform.Field`` (and ``deform.Form``) objects to accept a
  "resource registry" as a constructor argument.

- Add the ``deform.Field.set_widgets`` method, which allows a
  (potentially nested) set of widgets to be applied to children fields
  of the field upon which it is called.

- Add the ``deform.widget.TextInputCSV`` widget.  This widget is
  exactly like the ``deform.widget.TextAreaCSV`` widget except it
  accepts a single line of input only.

- The default widget for ``colander.Tuple`` schema types is now
  ``deform.widget.TextInputCSV``.

- The ``deform.widget.FileUploadWidget`` now returns an instance of
  ``deform.widget.filedict`` instead of a plain dictionary to make it
  possible (using isinstance) to tell the difference between file
  upload data and a plain data dictionary for highly generalized
  persistence code.

0.4 (2010-08-22)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When the hidden widget is used to deserialize a field, return
  ``colander.null`` rather than the empty string so that it may be
  used to represent non-text fields such as ``colander.Integer``.
  This is isomorphic to the change done previously to
  ``deform.TextInputWidget`` to support nontextual empty fields.

- Fix typo about overriding templates using set_zpt_renderer in
  templating chapter.

- Fix link to imperative schema within in Colander docs within "Basics".

- Remove duplicate ``deform.widget.DateInputWidget`` class definition.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add a ``deform.widget.RichTextWidget`` widget, which adds the
  TinyMCE WYSIWIG javascript editor to a text area.

- Add a ``deform.widget.AutocompleteInputWidget`` widget, which adds
  a text input that can be supplied a URL or iterable of choices to
  ease the search and selection of a finite set of choices.

- The ``deform.widget.Widget`` class now accepts an extra keyword
  argument in its constructor: ``css_class``.

- All widgets now inherit a ``css_class`` attribute from the base
  ``deform.widget.Widget`` class.  If `css_class`` contains a value,
  the "primary" element in the rendered widget will get a CSS
  ``class`` attribute equal to the value ("primary" is defined by the
  widget template's implementor).

- The ``deform.Field`` class now as an ``__iter__`` method which
  iterates over the children fields of the field upon which it is
  called (``for item in field`` == ``for item in field.children``).

0.3 (2010-06-09)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Change default form action to the empty string (rather than ``.``).
  Thanks to Kiran.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add ``deform.widget.DateInputWidget`` widget, which is a date picker
  widget.  This has now become the default widget for the
  ``colander.Date`` schema type, preferred to the date parts widget.

- Add text input mask capability to ``deform.widget.TextInputWidget``.

- Add text input mask capability to
  ``deform.widget.CheckedInputWidget``.

Backwards Incompatibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Custom widgets must now check for ``colander.null`` rather than
  ``None`` as the null sentinel value.

- Dependency on a new (0.7) version of Colander, which has been
  changed to make using proper defaults possible; if you've used the
  ``default`` argument to a ``colander.SchemaNode``, or if you've
  defined a custom Colander type, you'll want to read `the updated
  Colander documentation <http://docs.repoze.org/colander>`_
  (particularly the changelist).  Short story: use the ``missing``
  argument instead.

- If you've created a custom widget, you will need to tweak it
  slightly to handle the value ``colander.null`` as input to both
  ``serialize`` and ``deserialize``.  See the Deform docs at
  `http://docs.repoze.org/deform <http://docs.repoze.org/deform>`_ for
  more information.

0.2 (2010-05-13)
----------------

- Every form has a formid now, defaulting to ``deform``.  The formid
  is used to compute the id of the form tag as well as the button ids
  in the form.  Previously, if a formid was not passed to the Form
  constructor, no id would be given to the rendered form and the
  form's buttons would not be prefixed with any formid.

- The ``deform.Form`` class now accepts two extra keyword arguments in
  its constructor: ``use_ajax`` and ``ajax_options``.

  If ``use_ajax`` is ``True``, the page is not reloaded when a submit
  button is pressed.  Instead, the form is posted, and the result
  replaces the DOM node on the page.

  ``ajax_options`` is a string which allows you to pass extra options
  to the underlying AJAX form machinery when ``use_ajax`` is True.

- Added a couple Ajax examples to the demo app.

- Add a rudimentary Ajax chapter to the docs.

0.1 (2010-05-09)
----------------

- Initial release.
