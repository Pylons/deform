Changes
=======

Next release
------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Sequence widgets are no longer ``structural`` by default; they now
  print the label of the sequence above the sequence adder.

- The sequence widget now scrolls a newly added sequence item into
  view when it is added.

- The sequence widget now puts the sequence adding link *after* any
  existing items in the sequence (previously the link was always
  beneath the sequence title).

- It is now possible to associate a widget with a schema node within
  the schema directly.  For example::

    import colander
    import deform.widget

    class MySchema(Schema):
        description = colander.SchemaNode(
                          colander.String(),
                          widget=deform.widget.RichTextWidget()
                          )

  For more information, see "Changing the Default Widget Associated
  With a Field" in the documentation.

- The constructor of ``deform.Field`` objects (and thus
  ``deform.Form`` objects) now accept arbitrary keyword arguments,
  each of which is attached to the field or form object being
  constructed, as well as being attached to its descendant fields
  recursively.

- The form object's template now respects the ``css_class`` argument /
  attribute of the form node.

- CheckboxChoice and RadioChoice widgets now use <ul> and <li> to
  display individual choice elements (thanks to Ergo^).

- The ``deform.widget.AutocompleteInputWidget`` widget now uses
  `JQuery UI's autocomplete sublibrary
  <http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete>` instead of the
  ``jquery.autocomplete`` library to perform its job in order to
  reduce the number of libraries needed by Deform.  Some options have
  been changed as a result, and the set of resources returned by
  ``form.get_widget_resources`` has changed.

  This change also implies that when a widget which uses a remote URL
  as a ``values`` input, the remote URL must return a JSON structure
  instead of a ``\n``-delimited list of values.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This Deform version requires ``colander`` version 0.7.2 or better.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``RichTextWidget``, ``AutocompleteInputWidget``, ``TextInputWidget``
  with input masks, and ``CheckedInputWidget`` with input masks could
  not be used properly within sequences.  Now they can be.  See also
  ``Internal`` and ``Backwards Incompatibilities`` within this
  release's notes.  This necessitated new required ``deform.load()``
  and ``deform.addCallback()`` JavaScript APIs.

- Radio choice widgets included within a submapping no longer put
  their selections on separate lines.

- Rich text widgets are now 500 pixels wide by default instead of 640.

Backwards Incompatibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The JavaScript function ``deform.load()`` now *must* be called by
  the HTML page (usually in a script tag near the end of the page, ala
  ``<script..>deform.load()</script>``) which renders a Deform form in
  order for widgets which use JavaScript to do proper event and
  behavior binding.  If this function is not called, built-in widgets
  which use JavaScript will no longer function properly.

- The JavaScript function ``deformFocusFirstInput`` was removed.  This
  is now implied by ``deform.load()``.

Internal
~~~~~~~~

- The date input widget now uses JQueryUI's ``datepicker``
  functionality rather than relying on JQuery Tools' ``date`` input.
  The latter was broken for sequences, and the former works fine.

- The various deform* JavaScript functions in ``deform.js`` have now
  been moved into a top-level namespace.  For example, where it was
  necessary to call ``deformFocusFirstInput()`` before, it is now
  necessary to call ``deform.focusFirstInput()``.

- Make the TinyMCE rich text widget use ``mode: 'exact'`` instead of
  ``mode: 'textareas'``.

- ``richtext``, ``autocomplete_input``, ``textinput``,
  ``checked_input``, and ``dateinput``, and ``form`` templates now use
  the new ``deform.addCallback`` indirection instead of each
  registering their own JQuery callback or performing their own
  initialization logic, so that each may be used properly within
  sequences.

- Change sequence adding logic to be slightly simpler.

- The sample app form page now calls ``deform.load()`` rather than
  ``deformFocusFirstInput()``.

- Added new demo app views for showing a sequence of autocompletes, a
  sequence of dateinputs, a sequence of richtext fields, and a
  sequence of text inputs with masks and tests for same.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a note about ``get_widget_resources`` to the "Basics"
  chapter.

- Added a note about ``deform.load()`` JavaScript requiredness to the
  "Basics" chapter.

- Add new top-level sections named ``Widget Templates`` and ``Widget
  JavaScript`` to the "Widgets" chapter.

0.5 (2010-08-25)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added features which make it possible to inquire about which
  resources (JavaScript and CSS resources) are required by all the
  widgets that make up a form rendering.  Also make it possible for a
  newly created widget to specify its requirements.  See "Widget
  Requirements and Resources" in the widgets chapter of the
  documentation.

- Add the ``get_widget_requirements`` method to ``deform.Field``
  objects.

- Add the ``get_widget_resources`` method to ``deform.Field``
  objects.

- Allow ``deform.Field`` (and ``deform.Form``) objects to accept a
  "resource registry" as a constructor argument.

- Add the ``deform.Field.set_widgets`` method, which allows a
  (potentially nested) set of widgets to be applied to children fields
  of the field upon which it is called.

- Add the ``deform.widget.TextInputCSV`` widget.  This widget is
  exactly like the ``deform.widget.TextAreaCSV`` widget except it
  accepts a single line of input only.

- The default widget for ``colander.Tuple`` schema types is now
  ``deform.widget.TextInputCSV``.

- The ``deform.widget.FileUploadWidget`` now returns an instance of
  ``deform.widget.filedict`` instead of a plain dictionary to make it
  possible (using isinstance) to tell the difference between file
  upload data and a plain data dictionary for highly generalized
  persistence code.

0.4 (2010-08-22)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When the hidden widget is used to deserialize a field, return
  ``colander.null`` rather than the empty string so that it may be
  used to represent non-text fields such as ``colander.Integer``.
  This is isomorphic to the change done previously to
  ``deform.TextInputWidget`` to support nontextual empty fields.

- Fix typo about overriding templates using set_zpt_renderer in
  templating chapter.

- Fix link to imperative schema within in Colander docs within "Basics".

- Remove duplicate ``deform.widget.DateInputWidget`` class definition.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add a ``deform.widget.RichTextWidget`` widget, which adds the 
  TinyMCE WYSIWIG javascript editor to a text area.

- Add a ``deform.widget.AutocompleteInputWidget`` widget, which adds
  a text input that can be supplied a URL or iterable of choices to
  ease the search and selection of a finite set of choices.

- The ``deform.widget.Widget`` class now accepts an extra keyword
  argument in its constructor: ``css_class``.

- All widgets now inherit a ``css_class`` attribute from the base
  ``deform.widget.Widget`` class.  If `css_class`` contains a value,
  the "primary" element in the rendered widget will get a CSS
  ``class`` attribute equal to the value ("primary" is defined by the
  widget template's implementor).

- The ``deform.Field`` class now as an ``__iter__`` method which
  iterates over the children fields of the field upon which it is
  called (``for item in field`` == ``for item in field.children``).

0.3
---

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Change default form action to the empty string (rather than ``.``).
  Thanks to Kiran.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add ``deform.widget.DateInputWidget`` widget, which is a date picker
  widget.  This has now become the default widget for the
  ``colander.Date`` schema type, preferred to the date parts widget.

- Add text input mask capability to ``deform.widget.TextInputWidget``.

- Add text input mask capability to
  ``deform.widget.CheckedInputWidget``.

Backwards Incompatibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Custom widgets must now check for ``colander.null`` rather than
  ``None`` as the null sentinel value.

- Dependency on a new (0.7) version of Colander, which has been
  changed to make using proper defaults possible; if you've used the
  ``default`` argument to a ``colander.SchemaNode``, or if you've
  defined a custom Colander type, you'll want to read `the updated
  Colander documentation <http://docs.repoze.org/colander>`_
  (particularly the changelist).  Short story: use the ``missing``
  argument instead.

- If you've created a custom widget, you will need to tweak it
  slightly to handle the value ``colander.null`` as input to both
  ``serialize`` and ``deserialize``.  See the Deform docs at
  `http://docs.repoze.org/deform <http://docs.repoze.org/deform>`_ for
  more information.

0.2 (2010-05-13)
----------------

- Every form has a formid now, defaulting to ``deform``.  The formid
  is used to compute the id of the form tag as well as the button ids
  in the form.  Previously, if a formid was not passed to the Form
  constructor, no id would be given to the rendered form and the
  form's buttons would not be prefixed with any formid.

- The ``deform.Form`` class now accepts two extra keyword arguments in
  its constructor: ``use_ajax`` and ``ajax_options``.

  If ``use_ajax`` is ``True``, the page is not reloaded when a submit
  button is pressed.  Instead, the form is posted, and the result
  replaces the DOM node on the page.

  ``ajax_options`` is a string which allows you to pass extra options
  to the underlying AJAX form machinery when ``use_ajax`` is True.

- Added a couple Ajax examples to the demo app.

- Add a rudimentary Ajax chapter to the docs.

0.1 (2010-05-09)
----------------

- Initial release.
