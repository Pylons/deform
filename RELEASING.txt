Distributing a new release
==========================

- For clarity, we define releases as follows.

  - Alpha, beta, dev and similar statuses do not qualify whether a release is
    major or minor. The term "pre-release" means alpha, beta, or dev.

  - A release is final when it is no longer pre-release.

  - A *major* release is where the first number either before or after the
    first dot increases. Examples: 0.9.0 to 2.0.

  - A *minor* or *bug fix* release is where the number after the second dot
    increases. Example: 2.0 to 2.0.1.

Prepare new release branch
--------------------------

- Create a new release branch, incrementing the version number.

- Align the release number with deformdemo.

- Do any necessary branch merges (e.g., master to branch, branch to master).

- On release branch:

    git pull

- Make sure your Python has ``setuptools-git``, ``twine``, and ``wheel``
  installed:

    $VENV/bin/pip install setuptools-git twine wheel

- Do a platform test:

    tox -r

- Ensure all features of the release are documented (audit CHANGES.txt or
  communicate with contributors).

- Change CHANGES.txt heading to reflect the new version number.

- Update README.rst to use correct versions of badges and URLs according to
  each branch and context, i.e., RTD "latest" == GitHub/Travis "2.0-branch".

- For major version releases, in contributing.md, update branch descriptions.

- For major version releases, in docs/conf.py, update values under
  html_theme_options for in_progress and outdated across master, releasing
  branch, and previously released branch. Also in the previously released
  branch only, uncomment the sections to enable pylons_sphinx_latesturl.

- Change setup.py version to the release version number.

- Run a check with black, ensure the PyPI long description renders, and run
  check-manifest with the following command.

    $VENV/bin/tox -e lint

- Build an sdist and a wheel:

    $VENV/bin/tox -e build

- Release the wheels to PyPI:

    $VENV/bin/twine upload dist/deform-X.Y.Z-*

- Upload a git tag for the release:

    git tag X.Y.Z
    git push origin X.Y.Z

- Update RTD to render a new version of the docs at that tag X.Y.Z and set
  X.Y.Z as the default branch such that ``/latest/`` points to it.

- Publish new version of docs.

- Update deform demo site

- Announce to Twitter.
